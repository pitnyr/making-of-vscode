# VS Code Extension for Writing Making-Of Docs


## Goal

Support for writing "Making-Of" docs in VS Code.


## Features

- [ ] Automatically perform commits from within the "Making-Of" docs


## Plan

Here's a possible way to proceed:

For automatically performing commits I could use the "Edit With Shell Command" extension.
I decided to write my own extension instead,
because on one hand this extension offers way too much functionality,
while on the other hand it lacks a way to pass additional infos to the shell command.

I've never written a VS Code extension before,
so I think I'll start with the getting started example
and then add more and more functionality from the "Edit With Shell Command" extension.

## Step 2

For setting up the getting started example I create a feature branch named "[start](start.md)".
